            <p>Specific knowledge and understanding of all possible access solutions no longer can be restricted by the
                limitations of any specific supplier or market sector. A broad knowledge and complete understanding of
                the total access market and available methods is necessary to develop the optimum solution for the
                specific application and requirements of the client.</p>
            <p>REEF is uniquely qualified to provide the required level of expertise to produce cost effective and
                practical solutions that will compliment the overall design of the building, operating environment,
                local restrictions and aspirations of the client.</p>
            <p> REEF will carry out a comprehensive risk assessment analysis and recommend necessary actions for
                compliance with all current and projected Health &amp; Safety legislation and CDM regulations, providing
                technical support to the total Design Team.</p>
            <p>Due regard shall be given to future changes in statutory regulation, codes and HSE guidance to ensure the
                systems provided acknowledge and where appropriate incorporate and exceed those requirements.</p>

                Develop facade panel/glazing replacement strategies<br/>
                Provide generic design information of spatial, structural, and services requirements <br/>

                supplier<br/>
