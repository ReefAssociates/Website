      <br />
      <p>REEF Associates Ltd is probably the leading specialist consultancy practice in the  field of Fa&ccedil;ade Access Equipment.<br />
        <br />
        As building designs become more complex and the need for effective  external maintenance becomes more crucial the need for specific knowledge and  understanding of all possible access solutions also becomes crucial.<br />
        <br />
        REEF is uniquely qualified to provide the required level of expertise to  produce cost effective and practical solutions that will compliment the overall  design of the building fa&ccedil;ade. <br />
        <br />
      We feel we are unique in the level of service and technical resource we  provide on any project in that we develop schemes to &ldquo;maintain the fabric of  the building&rdquo;. This goes beyond routine cleaning to encompass the longer term  requirements of fa&ccedil;ade maintenance and replacement of elements of the fa&ccedil;ade. </p></td>
